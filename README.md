## SECTION 1 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

------
`    `Our project develops an advanced speech recognition-based polygraph system with the aim of providing an innovative alternative to the traditional polygraph for criminal investigations and other areas. The traditional methods, for example the polygraph, have been the subject of criticism on ethical grounds and with regard to their reliability. In view of this, we propose a voice-based polygraph model that uses machine learning to enhance detection accuracy. This provides a more transparent, non-intrusive and adaptable solution for detection. 
  
  `    `The project addresses the shortcomings of existing polygraph techniques, particularly in regard to data transparency, model interpretability and cross-domain applicability. They are achieved by integrating a range of machine learning models (including Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, KNN and others) and we utilise the soft-voting integration methods to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the predictions.  
    
`    `From a commercial perspective, the project's voice lie detector system has the potential for a wide range of applications in multiple fields, including criminal justice, corporate censorship and insurance claims. Our system can be offered on a per-use or subscription basis through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud platform model, making it suitable for a variety of users, including law enforcement agencies, healthcare organisations, insurance companies, and corporate users. The system has been developed with the objective of meeting the specific needs of a range of enterprises. It could assist customers in making efficient judgments in different scenarios such as employee selection, internal vetting, and fraud detection.
